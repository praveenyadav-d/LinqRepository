Suggested Process Improvements
In my point of view no reason for putting toggle button in the page setting view phone or email at the bottom of the page because it is already a require field and it is already enabled
2.Add real-time validation with descriptive error messages (e.g., "Phone number must be 10 digits").
3.Implement dynamic UI updates after actions like delete or update.
My Approach to Exploratory Testing
1.Started by understanding user intent and business context of the application
2.Gone through each and every section of the application to understand the UI, identify usability issues, and ensure consistency in design and functionality across all components.
3.Use mind maps to identify functional areas and edge cases to identify any bugs or issues
4.Focus on UI, API responses, usability, and security touchpoints.
